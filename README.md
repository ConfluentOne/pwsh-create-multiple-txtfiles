# pwsh-create-multiple-txtfiles
Create Multiple txt/log files with dummy data

Created this to incrementally create .log files (or any type of file you want). Used for creation of files for different purposes such as file renaming, .zip-by-date testing, etc...

I still have to fix the logic for the file name, it's a little too long right now. Future fix for that hopefully.
